# Memories
created MERN stack web app with google OAth and used React.js with Material-UI. Express.js and Node.js for the back-end and MongoDB for the database. 
This project was created so I can better learn how to use Authentication in web apps. This is a crud project but uses google OAth and JSON web tokens so you can only create, update, and delete post you made and not every single one.
